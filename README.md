- This script will help automate copying windows eventlog from a remote machine (or even a Virtual machine). As part of Malware analysis we do need to run infected machines in a Natted network and still be able to copy windows event logs

- Later these logs can be analysed using Splunk for specific windows events in the process of threat hunting.
